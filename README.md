# Text RPG Game
This project was based on Penn State's Object Oriented Programming course (CMPSC 221). Purpose of the semester-long assignment was to design and create a text based RPG game. Objective of the game is to nagivate through the different virtual rooms and find the hidden treasure chest. Project was programmed with Java and built using an object-oriented problem solving approach. 

Assignment can be classified into 3 different subsections including Model, Controller and View. Model consists of all the individual components of the game including player model with inventory system, direction options, and room descriptions. Controller controls user inputs to navigate through the game while displaying the corresponding outputs from model. View implements the user interface of the game using Java's Swing GUI.
